# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to use deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow platform in Python, to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.
Use the following methods for the analysis:

* Preprocessing the data for the neural network model,
* Compile, train and evaluate the model,
* Optimize the model.
# Results

# Data Preprocessing
* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? We can see in the picture above that the target variable in this "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column.

* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
The feature variables would be the remaining variables in our database. They are APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and ASK_AMT.

* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
The two variables of EIN and NAME. Each variable was dropped from our data set.

# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
