# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to use deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow platform in Python, to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.
Use the following methods for the analysis:

* Preprocessing the data for the neural network model,
* Compile, train and evaluate the model,
* Optimize the model.
# Results

# Data Preprocessing
The columns EIN and NAME are identification information and have been removed from the input data.
The column IS_SUCCESSFUL contains binary data which refers to if the charity donation was used effectively, or not effectively. This variable is considered the target for our deep learning neural network.
The following columns: APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT, are the features for our model.
Encoding of the categorical variables, splitting into training and testing datasets, and standardization have been applied to the features.

* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
