# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to use deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow platform in Python, to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.
Use the following methods for the analysis:

* Preprocessing the data for the neural network model,
* Compile, train and evaluate the model,
* Optimize the model.
# Results

Data Preprocessing

* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
